This is a supervised learning model which uses logistic regression to predict whether the news is fake or not.

I've made the code on jupyter but it can also be run on google colab with a few minor changes.

The link to the dataset is here https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data?select=train.csv

Dataset hasn't been uploaded as the size of the file is too large.
